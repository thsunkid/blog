I've come to realize the importance of a secret sense of humor as adults. 

Adult life is a non-stop comedy, filled with our self-contradictions, foolish looks, superficial thoughts - vulnerabilities that might feel too dangerous to expose to the society, yet wonderful to watch and laugh at.  

Taking yourself too seriously, you miss out on a great show üçø (and a chance to grow).
